polkit-unauthorized-file="""
A custom polkit rule file is installed by this package.
"""


polkit-unauthorized-privilege="""
The package allows unprivileged users to carry out privileged operations
without authentication. This could cause security problems if not done
carefully.
"""


polkit-untracked-privilege="""
The privilege is not listed in /etc/polkit-default-privs.* which makes it
harder for admins to find.  Furthermore polkit authorization checks can easily
introduce security issues.
"""


polkit-cant-acquire-privilege="""
Usability can be improved by allowing users to acquire privileges via
authentication. Use e.g. 'auth_admin' instead of 'no' and make sure to define
'allow_any'. This is an issue only if the privilege is not listed in
/etc/polkit-default-privs.*
