intended for inclusion in any SUSE product please open a bug report to request
review of the package by the security team. Please refer to

"""


polkit-unauthorized-privilege="""
The package allows unprivileged users to carry out privileged operations
without authentication. This could cause security problems if not done
carefully. If the package is intended for inclusion in any SUSE product please
open a bug report to request review of the package by the security team. Please
refer to
https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_security_guidelines#audit_bugs for
more information.
"""


polkit-untracked-privilege="""
The privilege is not listed in /etc/polkit-default-privs.* which makes it
harder for admins to find.  Furthermore polkit authorization checks can easily
introduce security issues.  If the package is intended for inclusion in any
SUSE product please open a bug report to request review of the package by the
security team.  Please refer to
https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_security_guidelines#audit_bugs for
more information.
"""


polkit-cant-acquire-privilege="""
Usability can be improved by allowing users to acquire privileges via
authentication. Use e.g. 'auth_admin' instead of 'no' and make sure to define
'allow_any'. This is an issue only if the privilege is not listed in
/etc/polkit-default-privs.*
